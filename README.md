# ansible-mysql-cve-2016-6662
Simple ansible playbook to patch mysql servers against CVE-2016-6662.

## Summary of CVE
In brief, it will try to write a malicious .so to the filesystem and modify your configuration to load it at the next service restart.

## Summary of patch
This patch will not prevent the actual attack, but it modifies mysqld\_safe so .so files are only loaded from the standard system locations, where mysqld cannot write.

## The longer bit
The full issue is available at https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6662 ; Kenny Gryp of Percona has posted a brief-but-excellent explanation at https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/09/12/database-affected-cve-2016-6662/ .

This playbook will try to apply the Percona patch in https://github.com/percona/percona-server/commit/c14be53e029442f576cced1fb8ff96b58e89f2e0#diff-144aa2f11374843c969d96b7b84247eaR261 .

It will:
 - Install the standard _patch_ package if not present
 - Find the location of your mysql\_safe executable using _which_
 - Attempt to patch mysqld\_safe
 - Remove _patch_ again if we were the ones to install it

I have verified this on close to a hundred installations - mostly Debian, a couple of RedHat and Suse ones.

I've observed the _patch_ fail on 5.1 setups, as the mysql\_safe script does not contain the anchor points - but that version (and lower) is also not vulnerable, so this is not a problem.

Note that a changed= value of 0 or 2 means no patch was done (2 if installed and removed _patch_); 1 or 3 means the patch was performed. Other valued are unexpected and should be investigated :-)

Thanks to Kenny Gryp and Percona for the clear explanation and easy workaround.
